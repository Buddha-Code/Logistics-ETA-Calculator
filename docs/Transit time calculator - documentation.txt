Language and Framework
Language: Python 3.12
GUI Framework: Tkinter
External Services: Google Maps API, weather.gov (NOAA/NWS)


Required Libraries

Standard:
-	tkinter, datetime, time, math
-	json, os, re, pathlib, urllib.parse
-	xml.etree.ElementTree, threading
Third-Party:
-	requests
-	geopy
-	dateutil

Core Functions
1.	calculate_eta():
-	Estimates ETA based on miles, speed, HOS rules
-	Supports planning by arrival or departure

2.	calculate_smart_eta():
- Uses Google Maps traffic + weather.gov alerts
- Spaced sampling along route via polyline
- Integrates break rules, traffic delays, and mountain state logic

3.	open_density_calculator() & calculate_density():
- GUI tool for pallet entry and NMFC class
- Computes density, class, and LTL linear footage
- Applies per-carrier overlength rules and blinking alerts

4.	get_weather_alerts(lat, lon):
-	Calls NWS Atom feed + alert API
-	Summarizes weather threats (ice, fog, wind, etc.)

5.	get_weather_along_route_parallel():
-	Spaced sample points with async alert queries
-	Merges alerts and returns combined route warning list

6.	generate_smart_recommendations():
-	Suggests driver/equipment based on cold states, tight windows, weekend rules
-	Also flags holidays using get_us_holidays()

7.	get_coordinates(), reverse_geocode_state_and_county():
-	Used for mapping and region analysis

8.	contact_help(), open_help_window():
-	Offers UI help / opens email support window

Carrier Overlength Logic
-	Rules stored in a structured dictionary by carrier
-	Triggers at various pallet and total length breakpoints
-	Alerts grouped and blink on violation

User Configuration
- Primary config stored in: Documents/Transit Time Calculator/eta_config.json
- Other user files include:
- eta_log.txt (ETA tracking)
- weather_cache.json (NWS alerts)
- zip_county_cache.json (for reverse geocoding)
- user_nmfc_data.json (user NMFC freight mappings)

Logging and Troubleshooting
-	Uses log_info, log_debug, log_warning, log_error
-	Captures calculation inputs, flow logic, and UI events
-	Common issues: 0 volume, invalid dates, traffic API fallback
